Built by Students is a showcase of projects done by students from elementry, middle, and high school. It's published and maintained by [Code 4 Puerto Rico](http://code4puertorico.org).


## Submissions
We do not accept all submissions. We only accept submissions that can be verified and have great screenshots to showcase. All submissions must follow the instructions on the *How to submit* section below. We reserve the right to reject any submission. Submissions with inappropriate content will not be accepted.

If a submission has a picture of a minor it must be accompanied with the writen consent of the minor's guardian.

## How to submit
To submit a site suggestion, [open an issue](https://github.com/Code4PuertoRico/built-by-students/issues/new) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/Code4PuertoRico/built-by-students). 
Pull requests will be given higher priority since they are easier to include. 
Make sure the screenshot is 1000x800 and please double check that everything looks good before submitting. 
It's also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before including it. 
This will help keep the website fast and the repository small as possible.

## About the site
Inspired by [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/). It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/getblimp/built-with-ember), and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
