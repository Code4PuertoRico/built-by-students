# [Built by Students Website](http://bbs.code4puertorico.org)

A list of awesome projects built by elementry, middle, and high school students.

This projects was inspired by a teacher who lamented not having a way to show off her students projects. Hearing this we 
decided to create Built by Students in an effort to provide a place to showcase these projects.

### Submissions
We are trying to keep the site submission quality as high as possible. Please only submit real world applications running in 
production environments. Make sure that you can link to the application directly and no demos or proof-of-concepts. 
Only finished applications allowed.

### How to submit
To submit a site suggestions, [open an issue](https://github.com/GetBlimp/built-with-ember/issues/new) or create a pull request. Pull requests will be given higher priority since they are easier to include.

Make sure the screenshot is **1000x800** and please double check that everything looks good before submitting. It's also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) or [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before including it. This will help keep the website fast and the repository small as possible.

### Running the site locally
```
$ gem install jekyll
$ git clone https://github.com/GetBlimp/built-with-ember.git
$ cd built-with-ember
$ jekyll serve --watch
```
